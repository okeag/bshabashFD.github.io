title: Why Randomness is great for 2% of financial managers
---


Suppose you have a 10,000 'Financial advisors' and suppose that they would get fired if they lose money. 

Now suppose that we have a market where the money manager makes 10,000$ or loses 10,000$ at the flip of a coin.

After one year, you would have only 5000 'Financial advisors'

After two and three years; 2500 and 1250

After four and five years; 625, and 313 (give or take)

Now of these 300 so-called 'financial advisors': How many do you think are still working due to random chance? 

If you run into one of these people on the street, what are the odds that they will take themselves a little too seriously?
